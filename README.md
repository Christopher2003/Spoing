Spoing into Action!
===================

Spoing is a set of libraries and sample source code to simplify
building and deploying lightweight, fast-loading, cross-platform
(Windows, Linux and MacOS) desktop and Web applications from one pure
Java source code base. No XML, CSS, HTML, or Javascript is required.

If you want to quickly write and deploy an application to run on any
desktop and/or the Web, Spoing makes it easy to do it.

Spoing includes everything you need to get started, including:
* An embedded Tomcat server for launching Web applications (https://tomcat.apache.org/)
* The SWT desktop UI libraries from Eclipse.org (https://www.eclipse.org/swt/)
* The RAP/RWT Web UI libraries from Eclipse.org (https://www.eclipse.org/rap/)
* Libraries to abstract away differences between SWT and RAP/RWT (https://www.eclipse.org/rap/developers-guide/devguide.php?topic=rwt.html)
* Sample application code

The provided libraries are easily separable, so you can either release
for all supported platforms -- i.e., Windows, Linux, MacOS, Web -- or
a subset if you wish.

Future updates will:
* Consider integration with (for example) Tabris
(https://eclipsesource.com/products/tabris/) to enable mobile app
targets;
* Where possible, move portions of sample code to the libraries, to
simplify creating new applications.
